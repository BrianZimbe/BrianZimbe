👋 Hi, I’m @BrianZimbe.

👀 I specialize in end-to-end web and application development, focusing on building scalable, high-performance solutions. On the front end, I leverage JavaScript frameworks like Angular to create dynamic, interactive user interfaces. My back-end expertise spans multiple frameworks and languages, including Python (FastAPI, Flask), Node.js, and Java with Spring Boot, allowing me to build robust RESTful and asynchronous services tailored to complex workflows.

I’m skilled in database management and optimization, with proficiency in MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MS SQL Server, ensuring data integrity and efficient query handling across various architectures. My experience includes designing and implementing RESTful APIs, enabling seamless, secure integration with third-party services and facilitating microservices architecture.

💞️ I’m interested in collaborating on advanced web and backend solutions.
